# Cryto Investment

In this Challenge, I combined the financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills acquired in this module.

I created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies. I then plot the results so that I can visually show the performance to the board.

The CSV file provided for this challenge contains price change data of cryptocurrencies.

## Key Tasks:
1. Import the Data 
2. Prepare the Data
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means
4. Find the Best Value for k
5. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
6. Visualize the Results


## Installation Guide
Before running the application first install and import the following library & dependencies:

1. import pandas as pd
2. import hvplot.pandas
3. from path import Path
4. from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
5. from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
6. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
